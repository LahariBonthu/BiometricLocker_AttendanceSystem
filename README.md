# BiometricLocker_AttendanceSystem
 
The main objective of this project is to design a fingerprint sensor locker such that system can be accessed using a reliable fingerprint sensor to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the locker. Creating a system that accurately records attendance data for users, including timestamps and user identifiers and integrating this to a reliable locking mechanism controlled by the system to secure the contents present in the locker.
